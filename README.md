## Introduction

The Tourism India project is a web application that helps tourists plan their trips to India. The application allows users to provide their preferences, such as nationality, type of visit, accommodation preferences, sightseeing activities, and more. Based on these inputs, the application generates a custom travel report for the user, providing them with personalized recommendations and useful information for their trip.

## Still in Development

Safety features are also incorporated within, such as SOS, which notifies nearby police stations and provides the location of nearby hospitals in case of emergencies. With the rising cases of harassment, I believe this could be an important feature to add.

## Features

- Select nationality and type of visit to India.
- Choose cities to visit and accommodation preferences.
- Specify the number of adults and children in the group.
- Indicate if special care is needed (childcare, health care, entertainment).
- Provide specific health care demands if required.
- Select sightseeing and activity preferences.
- Add any additional information for further customization.
- Generate a report with personalized recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js (JavaScript)
- Backend: Node.js (Express.js)
- Database: JSON (UserData.json)
- Map API: Google Maps API (for SOS functionality)
- PDF Generation: react-pdf/renderer
- Styling: Material-UI
